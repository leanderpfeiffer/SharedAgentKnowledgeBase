# Running the API using Docker

* As this repository relies on StarDog, a license key is required. If you have a license key, place it in the app/stardog/ directory.

* Make sure Docker compose is installed on your machine. Docker desktop natively also includes docker compose.

* With stardog ready, you can run ```docker-compose up``` in the main directory to build and run the required docker images.

* The API will be accessible following [this link](http://0.0.0.0:8000/docs#/).
